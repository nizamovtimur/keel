"""MCP tools for threats and their mitigation links.

Writes take a `fields` mapping rather than one parameter per field. A threat has ten
fields and a mitigation card sixteen; spelling each out doubles the tool schema every
client pays for on every conversation, and pushes past the eight-parameter mark where
models start mis-filling arguments. The field list is not lost — `get_style_guide` is
already the mandatory call before authoring, and it names every field with the bar it
has to meet. One place to look, not two that drift.
