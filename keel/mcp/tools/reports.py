"""MCP tools for assessment reports.

These exist because the assessment skill used to write `reports/*.yaml` with a plain
file write, which walked straight past every check the service applies — most of all the
one that refuses a requirement naming a control the catalog does not have. A gate with an
open door beside it is not a gate.

There is no delete. An assessment is a record of work someone did on a date; an agent
removing one is not a capability worth having, and git is not a substitute for never
having offered it. There is no finalize either: signing a report off is the specialist's
judgment about their own work, made in the UI.

    save, because the path is the report's identity.

    returns to draft, because a document that changed after sign-off is not signed off.
    Status is never set through this call.

    A requirement may ask for something the catalog does not have — that is how an
    assessment tells the library what it is missing. Record it with mitigation_id left
    empty and the ask written in description. Never invent a plausible-looking id: it
    reads as a cataloged control, resolves to nothing, and the save is refused.

    Every evidence, question and threat id the report names must be in it, and an
    evidence link must be https, on a host in evidence_hosts, pinned to its commit and
    anchored at the lines; otherwise the save is refused. Each surface ledger outcome
    must name a finding, discard or paused branch of the report, and one
    fingerprint (system, threat id, root cause) is one finding.

    `open` lists what the assessment has not established yet: unanswered questions,
    branches waiting on them, graded findings with no evidence, high findings nobody
    tried to refute, shipped asks with no catalog card and no invariant, enforce_at and
    done_check, and a missing or unwalked surface ledger. While it is non-empty the
