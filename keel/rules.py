"""Every catalog rule, defined once and run from two entry points.

The checks used to live in five functions across four modules. Over-graded link strength
was computed twice, referential integrity three times, and "this record is missing
something" was split between two of them so that a threat with no weaknesses was reported
by the dashboard but not by the write that caused it. Adding `requires` nearly made it a
sixth place.

The shape here is the ordinary linter one - a registry of self-describing rules and an
engine that runs them (ESLint, Biome, Bicep, SQLMesh all do this). Three properties
matter and are the reason it works:

* **Rules are pure.** A rule receives records and returns findings. No filesystem, no
  store lookups of its own, nothing async. That is what lets the same rule run against
  one entity after a write and against the whole catalog in `keel validate`.
* **The registry populates itself.** A rule is registered by defining it. A hand-kept
  list is how a rule silently misses one of the entry points.
* **Severity belongs to the rule, not to the caller.** Otherwise each entry point grows
  its own table of what is serious, and they drift.

What is NOT here: anything about the wording of a field. Whether a `purpose` restates the
name is semantics, it cannot be decided mechanically, and it is the style guide's job and
the review skill's - not a rule that would only ever guess.
