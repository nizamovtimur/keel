"""`keel recheck REPORT --repo PATH`: are the lines a report quotes still where it saw them?

A report pins every `read` evidence entry to a commit, a path, a line range and a
verbatim quote. Months later the code has moved on, and a reassessment needs to know
where to look first. This answers that without a model: for each quote it reads the
file at the checkout's HEAD and says one of

* **in place** — the quoted lines are still inside the recorded range;
* **moved** — the same lines are elsewhere in the file (the new range is printed);
* **gone** — the file no longer has them, or the file itself is gone;
* **not checked** — there is no checkout for that repository, or git could not read it.

None of these says a finding still holds or was fixed. "Gone" follows a fix and a
refactor alike, and "in place" says nothing about the controls around the lines. The
list is where to look first, not a verdict.

`command` and `test` entries are listed with their command and never run. A report is
written by a model, and a command in it is text nobody has reviewed yet: a person runs
it, or puts it in CI where it goes through review like any other change.

Quotes are compared line by line with surrounding whitespace ignored, so re-indenting
code does not read as a change. git runs with an argument list, read-only (`show`).
