"""Reading the coverage matrix, and turning it around.

The files are written source-first — every entry of a tracked release, present whether
or not Keel answers it. That direction is forced: the matrix's job is completeness of
somebody else's list, and a gap is only visible if the row exists to be empty.

A card needs the opposite view — "who names me" — so that is derived here rather than
stored twice. One direction on disk, both directions in the app.
