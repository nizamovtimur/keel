"""Access to `reports/` — an archive of assessment runs, one YAML file per assessment,
grouped into a folder per assessed system.

Unlike `keel/store.py`'s `Store`, nothing here is cached in memory: reports are read
fresh off disk on every call. The skill writes the first pass straight to disk; the
specialist then corrects it through `save_report` until `finalize_report` freezes it.

Two different things can happen to a finished report, and they are separate calls
because they mean separate things:

* `correct_report` — the assessment was right, the record was wrong. A typo, a
  mis-stated owner, a grade that came out of the conversation differently from how it
  was written down. It unlocks the SAME dated report for editing. The date does not
  move, because nothing was re-assessed.
* `reopen_report` — the system changed. New tools, new surface, new answers. This is a
  new assessment, so it gets a new date, carrying the previous findings forward as a
  starting point rather than making anyone retype them.

`save_report` still refuses a final report outright: unlocking is a deliberate act, not
something a stray keystroke does. Git is the audit trail — every one of these files is
versioned — so `status` records the state of the WORK, not a lock on the file.

Defensive by design: the archive holds many independent files, so one malformed or
schema-violating report is skipped in list views rather than failing the whole
request, and `get_report` reports the problem instead of raising.
