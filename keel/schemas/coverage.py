"""Coverage: what the sources we track say, and what Keel has to say back.

Keel's whole claim to trust is that it is not a fourth list nobody asked for. That claim
only means something if it is checkable, so each tracked source gets a file naming every
entry in a pinned release, and every entry gets one of three states.

The states are the point. `covered` is easy and everyone claims it. `gap` is the honest
admission that we have not got to it. `out_of_scope` is the one that earns a reader's
trust: it draws Keel's boundary with the reasoning attached, so someone who came looking
for an entry can see it was considered and where the line fell, rather than guessing
whether it was missed.

A row records the mapping and nothing else. Why a particular entry answers a source is a
property of that entry - it lives in the entry's `positioning`, because a row is about the
whole set of ids and a sentence written about one of them stops being true when a second
is added.

`out_of_scope` describes Keel, not the source. It is not a disagreement with the source's
judgment, and it is not the place to record "we cover this differently" - an entry Keel
answers in a shape of its own is `covered`, and the shape is explained on the entry.
The only thing that belongs here is a subject Keel does not model at all.
