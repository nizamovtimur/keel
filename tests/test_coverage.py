"""The coverage matrix: Keel's public claim about the sources it tracks.

The three states carry the whole point. `covered` is the easy one. `gap` is the honest
admission. `out_of_scope` is the one that buys trust — Keel's own boundary with the
reasoning attached. The schema refuses an out-of-scope row with no reason, and the rules
refuse a `covered` that names an entry which is not there.

What is tested here is the code: the validators and the derived views, on fixtures. What
the shipped catalog says is the rules' business, reached through `keel validate` and the
one bridge test in test_catalog.py, so that a content change never fails in Python.

`out_of_scope` describes Keel, never the source. An entry Keel answers in a shape of its
own - prompt injection, modelled as a mechanism across many threats rather than as one
row - is `covered`, and the shape is explained on the entry, in its `positioning`. A row
records the mapping and nothing else: it is about the whole set of ids answering a source,
so a sentence written about one of them stops being true when a second joins it.
