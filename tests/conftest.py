The important one is `catalog_dir`: a factory that writes a throwaway catalog under
`tmp_path`. Tests must state the content they are asserting on rather than reaching
into `catalog/` — a test bound to the real catalog stops testing its check and starts
locking the catalog's current state in place, so it fails the day the content is fixed.
