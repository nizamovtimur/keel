"""The UI is served at real paths, and the API keeps its own namespace.

Views used to live behind a `#` because the API owned `/threats` and `/mitigations` at
the root. The API moved under `/api`, which freed those paths for the app — but a
catch-all that answers everything will also answer `/api/typo` with 200 and a page of
HTML, so the exclusion is the part worth testing.
